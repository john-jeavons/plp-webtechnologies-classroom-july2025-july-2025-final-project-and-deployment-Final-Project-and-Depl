Lenana Girls High School Website
This is a multi-page, static website for Lenana Girls High School. The project is built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, following modern web development best practices. It's designed to be a clean, user-friendly, and informative digital presence for the school, providing key information to prospective students, parents, and the community.

Project Purpose and Goal
The primary goal of this project is to create a responsive, easy-to-navigate website that effectively communicates the school's values, mission, and vibrant community. The site serves as a central hub for essential information and aims to showcase the school's positive and professional environment.

Website Pages and Structure
The website is organized into five main pages, all accessible via a consistent top navigation bar:

Home (index.html): The landing page provides a welcoming introduction to the school with a hero section, brief snippets of content from other pages, and a news section to highlight recent achievements.

About Us (about.html): This page delves into the school's history, educational philosophy, and key achievements, using a clean layout with a mix of text and images.

Mission & Vision (mission.html): This page clearly outlines the school's mission, vision, and core values, presented in a structured and easy-to-read format.

School Life (schoollife.html): A dynamic gallery page that gives a glimpse into the school's vibrant community through images of extracurricular activities, events, and clubs.

Contact Us (contact.html): An essential page for user interaction, featuring a contact form with client-side validation, along with the school's contact details and social media links.

Key Features
Multi-Page Navigation: The site includes a persistent, consistent navigation bar across all pages. The active page is highlighted for a better user experience.

Mobile-First Design: The entire website is fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops. The navigation menu collapses into a hamburger icon on smaller screens, which is powered by a JavaScript function that toggles a CSS class.

Interactive Elements:

The Contact Us form includes basic client-side form validation to ensure fields are not empty and email format is correct.

The JavaScript code handles smooth scrolling for anchor links, providing a more fluid user experience when navigating to different sections.

Clean & Organized Code: The project follows best practices for file organization, with separate folders for CSS (css/), JavaScript (js/), and images (images/).

Semantic HTML5: The HTML is structured using semantic tags to improve accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).
